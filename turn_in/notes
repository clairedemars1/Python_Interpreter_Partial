todo:
- make the print(x) vs x = 3 vs x+=3 thing work 

todo longterm:

Notes:
	- I made NoneNode and UndefNode always "return values",but they can be returned from the symboltable to show that the val was not founds, so they're not really. it's ok for our purposes b/c we don't check them when they are returned

/*
Double Dispatch
	If c++ allowed double dispatch, then we could have written 4 functions 
		FloatLiteral::operator+( IntLiteral)
		FloatLiteral::operator+( FloatLiteral)
		IntLiteral::operator+( IntLiteral)
		IntLiteral::operator+( FloatLiteral)
	Instead of the 6 functions we have
		FloatLiteral::operator+(Literal)
		FloatLiteral::opPlus(float)
		FloatLiteral::opPlus(int)
		IntLiteral::operator+(Literal)
		IntLiteral::opPlus(float)
		IntLiteral::opPlus(int)
	How many?
		let n = num of kinds of literal 
		With double dispatch: n*n
		Without double dispatch: n*(1+n)
	So it's not a big deal
